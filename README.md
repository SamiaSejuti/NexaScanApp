# NexaScanApp
NexaScan is a CT Scan scheduling website, created to be used in hospitals. Patients can choose between doctors and can schedule their scan timing. They can rate the doctors and can write public reviews that other patients can see. Admins can send reports as attachments to the patients. And can also send marketing emails to patients in bulk. Patients, Doctors and Admins need to go through the authentication process at first to view the complete CT scan solution.

# What I learned
The website was created using ASP.NET framework MVC approach and C# language. The database used to store user information is the built-in SQL Server. I have used Bootstrap for making the website responsive. I have used HttpPostedFileBase for sending emails with attachments. I have used SignalR library to facilitate a real-time commenting and feedback system, which allows users to instantly leave a feedback without a page refresh. The interface has been kept very simple and minimal, providing a clean layout and prioritizing essential functions. The development methodology used is Code & Fix model.

# Run Environment:
Microsoft Visual Studio
